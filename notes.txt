make changes locally
see how it looks on 127.xxxxx url
push to github
sync python anywhere
stephlabou.pythonanywhere.com is the live site

where did my created posts go?
not yet accessible from live site - only through admin view

started putting some comments in .py files
should've started earlier...but have some notes in 'views.py'

confused about how local syncs with pyanywhere - it doesn't seem to in terms of posts

OK! local content WILL NOT TRANSFER TO GITHUB/PYTHONANYWHERE
Local posts are local
when push/pull git/pyanywhere, all that's going is the STRUCTURE of the web page
(e.g., the template and model and whatnot) but not the *content*
you wouldn't develop content (e.g., posts) on local because they won't sync to live page
these have been examples about getting FORMAT/STRUCTURE to match/mirror
but not content - the databases local and live are different, they won't sync

those links in posts don't redirect to anything, 
I don't get why the tutorial made those headings links...

see post_list.html for comments 
see blog.css for comments

google fonts and color pick are REALLY COOL
